        // A bouncing point moves counterclockwise along a circle with circumference 1 with jumps of constant length l<1, until it hits a gap of length g<1, 
        // that is placed in a distance d counterclockwise from the starting point.
        // The gap does not include the starting point, that is g+d<1.
        //
        // Let S(l, g, d) be the sum of the length of all jumps, until the point falls into the gap.
        // It can be shown that S(l, g, d) is finite for any irrational jump size l, regardless of the values of g and d.
        //
        // Examples: 
        // S(sqrt(1/2),0.06,0.7)=0.7071… 
        // S(sqrt(1/2),0.06,0.3543)=1.4142… 
        // S(sqrt(1/2),0.06,0.2427)=16.2634…
        //
        // Let M(n, g) be the maximum of ∑S(sqrt(1/p), g, d) for all primes p≤n and any valid value of d.
        //   
        // Examples:
        // M(3,0.06)=29.5425…, since S(sqrt(1/2),0.06,0.2427)+S(sqrt(1/3),0.06,0.2427)=29.5425… is the maximal reachable sum for g=0.06. 
        // M(10,0.01)=266.9010…
        //
        // Find M(100,0.00002), rounded to 4 decimal places.
        //
        // Notes:
